# AgiBot X2 Ground Recovery

## Overview and current status

HRS take-home: design an RL environment for recovery from lying on the back,
run a training experiment, and integrate recovery and telemetry with ROS 2.
This repository currently contains only repository setup and requirements capture.
Simulation, RL environment, ROS nodes, training and evaluation are **Pending**.
Evaluation: **Not evaluated**.

The two-page task brief, *AgiBot X2 Ground Recovery — Environment Design and ROS 2
Integration*, defines acceptance. References below provide implementation context.

## Target environment

Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 in Parallels, ROS 2 Jazzy, and MuJoCo.
These are project choices, not additional requirements imposed by the task PDF.

## Observed environment

Read-only inspection on 2026-09-20, executed inside the target VM:

| Item | Observed fact |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Ubuntu 24.04.5 LTS; Linux 7.0.0-31-generic; aarch64; dpkg architecture arm64 |
| Virtualization | `systemd-detect-virt`: parallels; platform identifies as Parallels ARM Virtual Machine |
| VM resources | 8 available CPUs; `free -h`: 11 GiB RAM, 4.0 GiB swap (rounded) |
| Python | System interpreter `/usr/bin/python3`, Python 3.12.3 |
| ROS 2 | `/opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` exists; sourced in a child shell; ROS_DISTRO=jazzy |
| ROS tools | `ros2` and `colcon` found after sourcing; system Python imports `rclpy` from Jazzy |
| MuJoCo | System Python import failed: `ModuleNotFoundError`; no version established |

This inventory does not establish X2 loading, simulation correctness, ROS communication,
or GPU capability. Other Python environments were not assessed.
MuJoCo availability and dependency compatibility remain future environment work.

## Acceptance criteria

The matrix defines required evidence; Pending items have not passed acceptance.
Source abbreviations refer to sections of the supplied task PDF:
**SIM** = p. 1, Simulation and reinforcement learning; **ROS** = p. 1, ROS 2 integration;
**IF** = p. 2, ROS 2 interfaces; **VAL** = p. 2, Validation;
**DOC** = p. 2, README requirements.

| ID | Deliverable | Acceptance criteria / required evidence | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Simulation and robot model | Select an AgiBot X2 URDF and simulator; load a floating base on a flat floor. Each episode resets to resting on the back without floor intersection. Configure collisions and respect joint/actuator limits. Document source, version, modifications and simulation settings; provide model-load, reset and limit evidence. Upstream XML availability alone is insufficient. | SIM; DOC | Pending |
| A2 | RL environment | Define observations, actions, reward, reset and episode end conditions. Explain reward terms, weights, rationale and recovery incentives, plus environment simplifications. Dimensions, gains, weights and thresholds must follow actual design and validation. | SIM; DOC | Pending |
| A3 | Training experiment | Actually run PPO or another RL algorithm. Save any produced policy checkpoint and a real training reward plot. Record algorithm, training settings and compute resources. No fabricated or placeholder data. Zero success does not waive training; document any genuine training blocker and apply A5's baseline fallback. | SIM; VAL; DOC | Pending |
| A4 | ROS 2 integration | Python or C++ package with recovery and telemetry nodes; colcon build and one launch file for both. Connect a real simulator. Accept before executing one episode with an available checkpoint or scripted baseline; reject concurrent requests. Publish simulator-derived status and actual joint states. Configurable timeout sends unsuccessful attempts to FAILED. Telemetry subscribes to both topics and logs status plus one joint position. Command targets or fabricated values are not measured telemetry. Docker is optional. | ROS; IF | Pending |
| A5 | Evaluation | Run five simulation episodes with the available policy; report success count and failures. Success means upright, stable standing on both feet without other body support. Define and document concrete success checks; no numerical thresholds are prescribed. Zero successes is acceptable with explanation. If training is blocked, evaluate and clearly label a scripted baseline. Reasonable hand contact during rising is not itself a failure of the final standing check. | VAL; DOC | Pending |
| A6 | Reproducibility and end-to-end validation | Verify a fresh ROS 2 build, one launch command for both nodes, and a CLI request that actually starts recovery in the simulator with live joint telemetry from that episode. Verify busy rejection and unsuccessful timeout to FAILED. Record actual commands and outcomes. Final README must cover dependencies/setup, simulation/training/evaluation commands, model and compute resources, environment/reward design, training settings, success checks/results, failure analysis/improvements, node responsibilities and build/launch/service/topic commands plus simulator integration. | VAL; DOC | Pending |

An empty-workspace build is not evidence for A6. Evaluation has not been run.

## ROS 2 interface contract

| Interface | Type | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/x2/start_recovery` | `std_srvs/srv/Trigger` | Return `success=true` when accepted, before episode execution; `success=false` when busy. Acceptance does not mean the robot has stood up. |
| `/x2/recovery_status` | `std_msgs/msg/String` | Publish `IDLE`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`. |
| `/x2/joint_states` | `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState` | Publish joint names, actual simulator positions and timestamps while running. |

Each accepted request executes exactly one episode. An unsuccessful attempt reaches
FAILED at its configurable timeout. Keep the required Trigger service and message types.
The telemetry node subscribes to joint states and recovery status and logs both the
current status and one joint position. Source: PDF p. 1 ROS; p. 2 IF and VAL.

## Planned implementation choices

- Use MuJoCo's native Python API on the target Ubuntu/Jazzy ARM64 environment.
- Consider Gymnasium with Stable-Baselines3 PPO, initially using CPU training.
- Implement both nodes in Python/rclpy.
- Prefer direct calls from the recovery node into a shared environment implementation.
- Determine the final model version, actuator setup, reward, training budget, success
  thresholds and dependency versions only after inspection and verification.

These are plans, not implemented features or PDF mandates. Reference projects do not
make ONNX, legged_control2, ros2_control or a separate simulator bridge dependencies.

## Development and verification status

Repository setup and acceptance criteria are documented. Implementation and end-to-end
verification remain pending. Runnable commands will be added as they are verified.

### Development history

The repository was established before implementation. Preserve meaningful commits and
push completed work throughout development (PDF p. 2, Commit history).
