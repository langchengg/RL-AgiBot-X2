# AgiBot X2 Ground Recovery

## Overview and current status

HRS take-home: design an RL environment for recovery from lying on the back,
run a training experiment, and integrate recovery and telemetry with ROS 2.
**Step 3 model audit complete** in the target VM. The pinned official model now has
one effective loader, source-consistent pelvis inertia, conservative joint ranges and
verified state/control mappings. CPU PPO and ROS compatibility were verified in Step 2.
OSMesa offscreen rendering works; the interactive viewer remains unstable on this VM.
X2 recovery control, its Gymnasium environment, final ROS nodes, training and evaluation
remain **Pending**. The diagnostic package does not implement recovery behavior.
Evaluation: **Not evaluated**.

The two-page task brief, *AgiBot X2 Ground Recovery — Environment Design and ROS 2
Integration*, defines acceptance. References below provide implementation context.

## Target environment

Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 in Parallels, ROS 2 Jazzy, and MuJoCo.
These are project choices, not additional requirements imposed by the task PDF.

## Observed environment

Checks rerun on 2026-09-20 inside the existing Parallels VM:

| Item | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| OS / virtualization | Ubuntu 24.04.5 LTS; Linux 7.0.0-31-generic; aarch64/arm64; Parallels |
| VM allocation | 8 CPUs; approximately 11 GiB RAM and 4 GiB swap |
| Disk | 62 GiB filesystem, 40 GiB available after installation (`df -h`, rounded) |
| Python | System `/usr/bin/python3` and project `.venv/bin/python`: 3.12.3 |
| Runtime identity | Installed executable uses `<checkout>/.venv/bin/python`; prefix `<checkout>/.venv`; base prefix `/usr` |
| ROS | Jazzy in `/opt/ros/jazzy`; rclpy 7.1.12; sensor_msgs, std_msgs, std_srvs 5.3.8 |
| Build tools | colcon-core 0.21.3; setuptools 68.1.2; ament-package 0.16.5 |
| Simulation / RL | MuJoCo 3.13.0; Gymnasium 1.3.0; Stable-Baselines3 2.9.0; PyTorch 2.8.0+cpu |
| Other direct dependencies | NumPy 1.26.4; cffi 2.1.1; Pillow 10.2.0 |
| Graphics | Virtio virtual VGA and renderD128; Mesa virgl, desktop OpenGL 4.0; DISPLAY=:0 |
| Rendering libraries | Python glfw 2.10.2; PyOpenGL 3.1.10; libosmesa6 25.1.7 |
| PyTorch backends | CPU used explicitly; CUDA=false, MPS=false; 2 compute threads, 1 interop thread |

The venv uses system site-packages: NumPy/Pillow come from Ubuntu, rclpy and interface
modules from Jazzy, and MuJoCo/Gymnasium/SB3/Torch from the venv. The installed diagnostic
prints module paths and interpreter identity in one process. No system Python packages
were replaced. Virtual graphics capability does not establish a training GPU.

## Acceptance criteria

The matrix defines required evidence; Pending items have not passed acceptance.
Source abbreviations refer to sections of the supplied task PDF:
**SIM** = p. 1, Simulation and reinforcement learning; **ROS** = p. 1, ROS 2 integration;
**IF** = p. 2, ROS 2 interfaces; **VAL** = p. 2, Validation;
**DOC** = p. 2, README requirements.

| ID | Deliverable | Acceptance criteria / required evidence | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Simulation and robot model | Select an AgiBot X2 URDF and simulator; load a floating base on a flat floor. Each episode resets to resting on the back without floor intersection. Configure collisions and respect joint/actuator limits. Document source, version, modifications and simulation settings; provide model-load, reset and limit evidence. Upstream XML availability alone is insufficient. | SIM; DOC | Pending |
| A2 | RL environment | Define observations, actions, reward, reset and episode end conditions. Explain reward terms, weights, rationale and recovery incentives, plus environment simplifications. Dimensions, gains, weights and thresholds must follow actual design and validation. | SIM; DOC | Pending |
| A3 | Training experiment | Actually run PPO or another RL algorithm. Save any produced policy checkpoint and a real training reward plot. Record algorithm, training settings and compute resources. No fabricated or placeholder data. Zero success does not waive training; document any genuine training blocker and apply A5's baseline fallback. | SIM; VAL; DOC | Pending |
| A4 | ROS 2 integration | Python or C++ package with recovery and telemetry nodes; colcon build and one launch file for both. Connect a real simulator. Accept before executing one episode with an available checkpoint or scripted baseline; reject concurrent requests. Publish simulator-derived status and actual joint states. Configurable timeout sends unsuccessful attempts to FAILED. Telemetry subscribes to both topics and logs status plus one joint position. Command targets or fabricated values are not measured telemetry. Docker is optional. | ROS; IF | Pending |
| A5 | Evaluation | Run five simulation episodes with the available policy; report success count and failures. Success means upright, stable standing on both feet without other body support. Define and document concrete success checks; no numerical thresholds are prescribed. Zero successes is acceptable with explanation. If training is blocked, evaluate and clearly label a scripted baseline. Reasonable hand contact during rising is not itself a failure of the final standing check. | VAL; DOC | Pending |
| A6 | Reproducibility and end-to-end validation | Verify a fresh ROS 2 build, one launch command for both nodes, and a CLI request that actually starts recovery in the simulator with live joint telemetry from that episode. Verify busy rejection and unsuccessful timeout to FAILED. Record actual commands and outcomes. Final README must cover dependencies/setup, simulation/training/evaluation commands, model and compute resources, environment/reward design, training settings, success checks/results, failure analysis/improvements, node responsibilities and build/launch/service/topic commands plus simulator integration. | VAL; DOC | Pending |

An empty-workspace build is not evidence for A6. Evaluation has not been run.

## ROS 2 interface contract

| Interface | Type | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/x2/start_recovery` | `std_srvs/srv/Trigger` | Return `success=true` when accepted, before episode execution; `success=false` when busy. Acceptance does not mean the robot has stood up. |
| `/x2/recovery_status` | `std_msgs/msg/String` | Publish `IDLE`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`. |
| `/x2/joint_states` | `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState` | Publish joint names, actual simulator positions and timestamps while running. |

Each accepted request executes exactly one episode. An unsuccessful attempt reaches
FAILED at its configurable timeout. Keep the required Trigger service and message types.
The telemetry node subscribes to joint states and recovery status and logs both the
current status and one joint position. Source: PDF p. 1 ROS; p. 2 IF and VAL.

## Implementation route

These project choices are separate from the PDF requirements:

- Official X2 Ultra v1.3.0 at `60c5de582c523cd188f563819e62d34cfdc3d2d0`, using native
  MuJoCo Python. Selecting this version does not approve its physical limits.
- Future environment: Gymnasium; learning: SB3 PPO with MlpPolicy, initially CPU.
- One ament_python package, eventually containing Python/rclpy recovery and telemetry
  nodes plus one launch file. Only the diagnostic entry point exists now.
- Recovery will directly use the same environment class as training/evaluation.
- Simulator torque semantics are verified below. RL actions, controller, reward, X2
  training budget and success thresholds remain future work.

No simulator bridge, ONNX, ros2_control or alternative simulation framework is required.

## Development and verification status

### Setup and fresh build

Run from the repository root. Jazzy and the existing Ubuntu Python/colcon packages are
prerequisites; do not install rclpy from PyPI. The inspected `/usr/bin/colcon` shebang uses
system Python, so invoke it explicitly with the venv interpreter.

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
# Only if .venv does not already exist:
# /usr/bin/python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
touch .venv/COLCON_IGNORE
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --only-binary=:all: --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu 'torch==2.8.0+cpu'
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --only-binary=:all: --index-url https://pypi.org/simple -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pip check
.venv/bin/python /usr/bin/colcon list --base-paths src
STEP2_DIR="$(mktemp -d /tmp/hrs-x2-step2.XXXXXX)"
.venv/bin/python /usr/bin/colcon --log-base "$STEP2_DIR/final-log" build \
  --base-paths src --packages-select x2_recovery --symlink-install \
  --build-base "$STEP2_DIR/final-build" --install-base "$STEP2_DIR/final-install"
source "$STEP2_DIR/final-install/setup.bash"
head -1 "$STEP2_DIR/final-install/x2_recovery/lib/x2_recovery/runtime_check"
```

PyPI metadata and official wheel listings were checked before installation: Gymnasium
and SB3 have universal wheels; Torch has a cp312 Linux aarch64 CPU wheel. SB3 2.9.0
accepts Torch >=2.8 and Gymnasium <2.0; these pins retain working MuJoCo/NumPy and avoid
CUDA packages or source builds. requirements.txt pins direct dependencies and the cffi
compatibility requirement from inherited PyNaCl; it is not a transitive lockfile.
No apt/build-tool changes were needed. Build outputs and raw logs stay in the temporary
directory; colcon discovers only src, and the venv has COLCON_IGNORE.

### Model source

The existing external checkout is reused, not vendored or modified. Source:
[AgibotTech/agibot_x2_urdf](https://github.com/AgibotTech/agibot_x2_urdf),
commit `60c5de582c523cd188f563819e62d34cfdc3d2d0`, **X2 Ultra v1.3.0**.
Reference URDF: `X2_URDF-v1.3.0/x2_ultra.urdf`; robot MJCF:
`X2_URDF-v1.3.0/x2_ultra.xml`; scene: `X2_URDF-v1.3.0/scene.xml`
(includes only that robot MJCF). Runtime loading is offline after setup:

```bash
export X2_ASSET_REPO="$HOME/.cache/hrs-x2-recovery/agibot_x2_urdf"
git -C "$X2_ASSET_REPO" rev-parse HEAD
git -C "$X2_ASSET_REPO" status --short
export X2_SCENE="$X2_ASSET_REPO/X2_URDF-v1.3.0/scene.xml"
```

Observed revision: `60c5de582c523cd188f563819e62d34cfdc3d2d0`; worktree clean.
For a new checkout, the previously verified download sequence is:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/AgibotTech/agibot_x2_urdf.git "$X2_ASSET_REPO"
git -C "$X2_ASSET_REPO" sparse-checkout set X2_URDF-v1.3.0
git -C "$X2_ASSET_REPO" checkout --detach 60c5de582c523cd188f563819e62d34cfdc3d2d0
```

The upstream Mulan PSL v2 license stays with the assets. No project license is granted
by this work; ROS package metadata uses UNLICENSED.

### Step 2 checks (historical)

Using the sourced overlay and the variables above:

```bash
timeout --kill-after=5s 120s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check runtime --x2-scene "$X2_SCENE"
MUJOCO_GL=osmesa timeout --kill-after=5s 40s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check render \
  --x2-scene "$X2_SCENE" --output "$STEP2_DIR/frames-osmesa"
```

The PPO dependency/runtime smoke test uses one Pendulum-v1 environment without rendering,
seed 42, MlpPolicy, device=cpu, n_steps=128, batch_size=64, n_epochs=2 and 1024 timesteps.
It checks finite data and parameters, an actual parameter change, checkpoint save/load,
and 32 deterministic prediction steps. PPO has a 60 s internal deadline and the complete
runtime command a 120 s external bound. Its temporary checkpoint is removed automatically.
These are compatibility checks, not X2 hyperparameters, convergence evidence, A3 training,
or any of the five A5 evaluation episodes.

Cross-process communication was checked with matching Fast DDS, domain 42, localhost-only
discovery and reliable/volatile keep-last-10 topic QoS. No global networking changes:

```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42 ROS_AUTOMATIC_DISCOVERY_RANGE=LOCALHOST RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
timeout --kill-after=5s 35s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check serve --seconds 20 > "$STEP2_DIR/server.log" 2>&1 &
smoke_pid=$!
trap 'kill "$smoke_pid" 2>/dev/null || true' EXIT
timeout --kill-after=5s 25s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check client --seconds 15
client_exit=$?
wait "$smoke_pid"
server_exit=$?
trap - EXIT
cat "$STEP2_DIR/server.log"
test "$client_exit" -eq 0 && test "$server_exit" -eq 0
```

The client waits for discovery and repeated publications, verifies String content,
JointState names/finite changing positions/timestamps, then checks the Trigger response.
The server reads `probe_hinge` qpos from the tiny simulated scene. Endpoints are only
`/x2_smoke/status`, `/x2_smoke/joint_states`, `/x2_smoke/ping`; none implement the final
recovery interfaces, busy rejection or recovery timeout behavior.

| Check (rerun in Step 2) | Status | Observed evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Complete stack in one process | PASS | Installed ros2-run entry point imports all requested modules from the intended runtime |
| pip check; NumPy/Torch interop | PASS | No broken requirements; shared-array conversion and finite CPU forward/backward gradients |
| Fresh ROS package build | PASS | One x2_recovery ament_python package; final fresh build 0.72 s; entry point shebang uses venv |
| Simple MuJoCo physics | PASS | 100 warm-up + 2000 timed steps; 4.0 simulated s; finite state, no warnings |
| Simple-scene timing | PASS | Load 0.000776 s; timed stepping 0.001944 s, approximately 1.03 million steps/s; loading/warm-up excluded |
| Pinned X2 regression | PASS | nq=38, nv=37, nu=31; 100 steps / 0.1 s, finite state, no warnings |
| PPO dependency/runtime smoke test | PASS | 1024 steps, 16 optimization epochs; 1.305 s setup/learning, 1.329 s including reload/rollout; max parameter change 0.0106144 |
| Cross-process ROS topics/service | PASS | 3 String and 3 JointState messages received; positions 0.392532, 0.383565, 0.371238 rad; Trigger success=true; both processes exit 0 |
| OSMesa offscreen frames | PASS | 320x240 simple/X2 PNGs saved and visually inspected: visible hinge/floor and complete robot/floor |
| Automatic GLFW desktop rendering | FAIL | Image-validity assertion failed; forcing X11 on the selected Wayland library was unsupported |
| Interactive viewer | FAIL | X11 variant opened for 2 s, but process exited with segmentation fault; software retry hit GLXBadDrawable and 20 s timeout |
| Recovery, robot training/evaluation | NOT RUN | A1-A6 Pending; evaluation Not evaluated |

The simple-scene timing is a short runtime measurement, not an X2 training-speed estimate.
OSMesa uses the already installed libosmesa6 25.1.7; no graphics packages/drivers were
changed. Interactive capability is unverified beyond opening a window. The bounded failed
viewer attempts used `PYGLFW_LIBRARY_VARIANT=x11 MUJOCO_GL=glfw` and then additionally
`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`, each with `timeout --kill-after=5s 20s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check viewer`.
All diagnostic processes were bounded and have exited. No core checks are blocked;
the graphics limitation is isolated to desktop rendering/viewer reliability.

### Step 3: effective model and evidence

`x2_recovery.model.load_effective_model(asset_repo=None)` is the only normal X2
loading path, including existing runtime/render diagnostics. It accepts a repository
path or `X2_ASSET_REPO`, otherwise the cache path under `Path.home()`. It checks the
pinned Git revision, relevant dirty/untracked files and XML/license hashes. It uses
MuJoCo 3.13.0 `MjSpec.from_file`, named edits and recompilation, preserving relative
includes/meshes without changing cwd. Every call returns a fresh model; no ROS,
Torch, SB3, rendering, probes, reports or network access are imported/performed by
this module. The audit alone compiles an explicitly labeled unmodified baseline.
Incompatible assets, patch preconditions and mappings raise explicit errors.

Seven in-memory overrides are applied, with old/new values and reasons in the report:

- **Pelvis inertial:** source MJCF omits it. AUTO mass inference includes the
  density-1000 collision mesh; visual meshes have density zero. Disabling contact
  masks leaves inferred mass unchanged, and doubling density doubles it in a
  disposable compilation. Raw pelvis mass **5.031810659 kg** becomes URDF
  **3.523487 kg**; robot total **43.474796659 → 41.966473 kg**.
  COM changes from `[-0.00152667, 0.00012933, 0.00289836]` to
  `[-0.001209, -0.000023, -0.002011]` m in the pelvis frame.
  The full tensor at COM, in pelvis axes, is
  `[[0.0126, 0, 0.000163], [0, 0.007924, -0.000005],
  [0.000163, -0.000005, 0.012417]]` kg m². `fullinertia` preserves the
  off-diagonals; the loader verifies the reconstructed compiled tensor.
- **Six range intersections (rad):** waist yaw `[-3.43,2.382] → [-3.43,2.2078]`;
  head yaw `±0.366 → ±0.349`; both wrist pitches `±0.558 → ±0.5236`;
  left wrist roll `[-1.571,0.724] → [-1.5097,0.724]`; right wrist roll
  `[-0.724,1.571] → [-0.724,1.5097]`. These are conservative **project policies**,
  not new official hardware specifications. Axis/sign/zero and parent-child
  transforms were checked first. No mass scaling, balancing, collision geometry,
  friction, solver or actuator-bound changes were made.

Recomputed differences: **12 joint ranges**, comprising six narrower retained
intervals and six wider intersected intervals; **zero rounding-only differences**
at the declared 1e-4 rad classification threshold. **13 effort-envelope differences**:
eight hip/knee motors plus waist yaw retain ±118 N m versus URDF ±120; four wrist
pitch/roll motors retain ±2.2 versus ±4.8. Other bounds agree. All 31 motors have
unit gain/gear, no bias or activation state, enabled input limits and enabled joint
actuation limits. Input clipping dominates the equal/wider downstream joint clamp;
that downstream clamp was **not independently exercised**. Absence of an actuator
`forcerange` does not mean unlimited joint effort. URDF speed limits are reported
but **not enforced** by this route; no hidden speed clamp was added.

| Audit area | Result | Measured evidence and scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Floating base | PASS | root pelvis (body 1), free joint 0; qpos address 0 (7 coordinates), DOF address 0 (6 velocities); nq=38, nv=37, nu=31; no equality, mocap, tendon, gravcomp or callbacks. Contact-free whole-robot COM drops 0.0495405 m in 100 ms, matching semi-implicit Euler gravity; valid independent translation/rotation tested. |
| Mass/inertia | PASS | 32 dynamic bodies; effective 41.966473 kg; qpos0 COM world `[0.00168761,0.00024727,0.71173956]` m. Positive principal moments and triangle inequalities; full common-frame tensors match URDF within export precision (max mass error 3.8e-5 kg, tensor error 4.65e-7 kg m²). Fixed sensor/base frames add no omitted mass. |
| Collision coverage | PASS, bounded poses | Back, both forearms, wrist/hand proxies, knee/shin meshes and feet have actual active floor force. Peak individual normal forces: back 448.54 N; forearms L/R 468.11/477.70 N; wrist proxies 77.21/141.48 N; shins 564.27/509.91 N; feet 344.44/386.04 N. Six 180 ms whole-model probes; largest floor penetration 10.99 mm (<15 mm), required-pose self penetration 2.66 mm (<5 mm); no warnings/reset. Four collision-only OSMesa images inspected. |
| Joint ranges | PASS | 31 coordinate-equivalent revolute joints, no unmatched movable/mimic joints; six restrictions, six stricter source ranges retained, 19 exact agreements. |
| Actuator semantics | PASS | 155 fresh forward checks: zero, ±40% and ±105% source inputs for every motor; sparse transmission moments, sign and measured actuator/joint forces agree within 1e-10 N m. Raw ctrl remains unclipped in its buffer. |
| Effective limits | PASS, stated scope | All finite joint bounds enabled. 62 lower/upper probes with 0.1 N m outward input, 80 ms each; explicit named limit constraints and restoring acceleration. Disposable copies disable contact/frictionloss and gravity only. Initial/peak penetration 0.002 rad (<0.005); max final 0.000270 rad (<0.001). Does not certify full-collision reachability of every bound. |
| Indexing | PASS | 31 unique controlled hinges; distinct nonzero positions/velocities and isolated inputs verified. Head motors occur before arms in ctrl order but after arms in joint traversal. No magic scalar-state slice or joint-ID/ctrl-index assumption. |

Settings remain timestep 0.001 s, gravity `[0,0,-9.81]` m/s², Euler integrator,
Newton solver, pyramidal cone, tolerance 1e-8, 100 iterations, all global disable
flags zero. The strict JSON report includes complete settings, inertias, geoms,
limits, actuator/mapping tables, source and project identities/hashes, definitions,
measurements, warning/time checks and evidence scopes. Quaternions are unit `wxyz`;
free-base linear velocity is world-frame and angular velocity is body-local.
The installed header/API behavior and
[MuJoCo 3.13.0 source](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/tree/3.13.0)
were checked, including sparse moments, clamp order and quaternion integration.

Mesh contact uses convex hulls. Each foot uses twelve 5 mm spheres, not its detailed
visual mesh; the floor is an infinite plane. No articulated hands/fingers exist.
Two original arm-at-side impact probes remain labeled **FAIL** in the report's
pose investigation: wrists become trapped against hip hulls (6.21/5.94 mm soft
penetration). The required arm-floor probes move the shoulder to -0.6 rad to
separate these contacts; physics, duration and thresholds stay unchanged.
This classifies the failure rather than claiming arbitrary-pose robustness.
The later supine reset must explicitly avoid such limb trapping. No episode-ready
reset, hardware calibration or recovery trainability is established. **A1-A6 stay
Pending; evaluation stays Not evaluated.** Next: implement and validate a reusable
supine reset, without starting training or controller design in this step.

### Reproduce Step 3 locally

Reuse the existing venv; do not repeat dependency installation for these checks.
All outputs below are under the explicitly ignored `audit-output/` directory.
The build was fresh and used the verified venv interpreter; ten regression tests
passed, including missing assets, wrong hashes/patch conditions, incompatible
mapping, wrong expected force, repeated loads and stale/failed-report handling.

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
export MUJOCO_GL=osmesa
export X2_ASSET_REPO="$HOME/.cache/hrs-x2-recovery/agibot_x2_urdf"
.venv/bin/python /usr/bin/colcon --log-base audit-output/step3-build/log build \
  --base-paths src --packages-select x2_recovery --symlink-install \
  --build-base audit-output/step3-build/build --install-base audit-output/step3-build/install
source audit-output/step3-build/install/setup.bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s src/x2_recovery/test -v
timeout --kill-after=5s 30s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check model
timeout --kill-after=5s 30s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check render \
  --x2-scene "$X2_ASSET_REPO/X2_URDF-v1.3.0/scene.xml" --output audit-output/step3/render
timeout --kill-after=5s 60s ros2 run x2_recovery runtime_check audit \
  --output audit-output/step3 --image-review-from audit-output/step3/report.json
```

The last command regenerates `audit-output/step3/report.json` and
`collision-{back,feet,left_arm,left_shin}.png`. It reuses only prior visual
observations whose SHA256 matches each **newly rendered** image; all numerical
checks rerun. On a fresh checkout omit `--image-review-from`: the command deliberately
returns nonzero with visual review NOT_TESTED. Inspect the four PNGs, then add an
`image_review` object to the report keyed by each PNG filename, each with the actual
`sha256` (from its image record) and a specific `observation` describing what was
seen. Rerun the last command. Missing/stale observations cannot yield COMPLETE.
No prior numerical PASS or completion verdict is trusted. A failed/incomplete
current run replaces the old report and exits nonzero; NaN/Infinity becomes a
failed measurement in strict JSON. Repeated loads, a different cwd and unchanged
upstream hashes are verified after the probes. PPO and ROS communication were not
rerun because these changes do not affect their implementations.

The controlled joints are both legs (6 each), waist (3), head (2) and both arms
including wrists (7 each). Use the compiled mapping to read actual state and write
control; this is the simulator interface, not an RL action space:

```python
from x2_recovery.model import load_effective_model
import mujoco

loaded = load_effective_model()  # independent MjModel, verified mapping
model = loaded.model
data = mujoco.MjData(model)
row = loaded.joint("head_yaw_joint")
position = data.qpos[row.qpos_address]  # discovered address 36, rad
velocity = data.qvel[row.dof_address]   # discovered address 35, rad/s
data.ctrl[row.ctrl_index] = 0.2         # motor_head_yaw_joint: ctrl 15, joint ID 30
mujoco.mj_forward(model, data)
torque = data.qfrc_actuator[row.dof_address]  # measured +0.2 N m
positions, velocities = loaded.read_state(data)  # copies in ctrl order
```

The audit's nonzero example reads 0.04 rad and -0.016 rad/s, then measures +0.2 N m
from +0.2 input. Robot loading does not maintain a pose or implement a controller.

### Development history

The repository was established before implementation. Preserve meaningful commits and
record completed work in local commits (PDF p. 2, Commit history). The current
user instruction overrides the PDF push request: **no remote writes without explicit
approval of the specific push/PR operation**. Step 3 is finished locally only.

  `2f94ff0ebd072e255d90bbbb2122d0f1a622a0b3`. README describes ROS 2 Humble,
  legged_control2 and ONNX inference with MuJoCo launch; tree includes
  `launch/mujoco.launch.py` and `config/agibot/x2/sim.yaml`.
  Its jammy-humble-amd64 installation route is not transferable to Jazzy ARM64.
  No apt sources or dependencies were adopted; compatibility and execution are unverified.

  `43ae110ea8aff9e5b482aa1e206b1f63217645e5`. README describes JointState publishing
  and command-topic input; tree includes `src/mujoco_ros.cpp`, `src/nodes/mujoco_node.cpp`
  and `include/mujoco_ros2/mujoco_ros.hpp`. Its declared tested stack is Ubuntu 22.04,
  ROS 2 Humble and MuJoCo 3.2.0. This is not evidence for Jazzy ARM64 or X2 compatibility.
  Reading `update_simulation()` confirmed qpos-to-position mapping, timestamps and publishing.
  Its joint indexing has not been validated for X2's floating base.
  Used only as a state-publication reference; no source was copied or executed.
